      <h2>About me</h2>
        I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne. I'm working on the <a href="https://www.swarmproject.info/about">SWARM Project</a>, which is part of <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/create">CREATE</a><br><br>
        I am committed to using my skills to further socially beneficial goals. In the summer of 2015 I was a fellow in the <a href="http://dssg.io/">Data Science for Social Good</a> summer fellowship. I am always looking for more opportunities to use data science for good.
