      <h2>About me</h2>
        I'm a data scientist at WSP.<br><br>
        

        I am committed to using my skills to further socially beneficial goals. In the summer of 2015 I was a fellow in the <a href="http://dssg.io/">Data Science for Social Good</a> summer fellowship. I am always looking for more opportunities to use data science for good.

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        I grew up in Castlemaine, VIC, Australia. I did a BA/BSc at The University of Melbourne, 
        triple-majoring in Genetics, Psychology, and the History & Philosophy of Science. 
        I did a MS in Machine Learning, and an MS and PhD in Logic, Computation and Methodology at Carnegie Mellon University. I moved back to Melbourne in 2017 for a postdoc, and have now transitioned to industry.
