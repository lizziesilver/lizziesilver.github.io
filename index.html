      <h2>About me</h2>
        I'm a PhD student in Logic, Computation & Methodology at Carnegie Mellon University. 
        I am also a masters student in Machine Learning at CMU.<br><br>
        I am committed to using my skills to further socially beneficial goals. In the summer of 2015 I was a fellow in the <a href="http://dssg.io/">Data Science for Social Good</a> summer fellowship. I am currently looking for more opportunities to use data science for good.
