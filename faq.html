        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>1. "How do you combine philosophy with machine learning?"</h3>
        I don't. I just do machine learning. 
        
        <h3>2. "So why did you get your PhD from a philosophy department?"</h3>
        <p>The short answer: I also did a masters in a Machine Learning department, concurrently.</p>
        <p>The long answer: I did a non-technical undergraduate degree. My research in philosophy of science 
        made me intensely curious about causation, and how we could learn about causal
        relationships from observational data, or from confounded experimental data. 
        Unfortunately, without a background in statistics, I couldn't pursue those 
        interests very far. </p>
        <p>I went looking for a grad program that would let me learn statistics. 
        I was amazed to learn that Carnegie Mellon's Department of Philosophy focused on causal
        questions. In fact, Professors Clark Glymour, Peter Spirtes and Richard 
        Scheines helped found the field of causal search &ndash; which is now a 
        niche area of machine learning. If the mark of a successful philosophical research 
        program is that it spreads outside of philosophy, causal search has been wildly 
        successful. </p>
        <p>The CMU Philosophy Department allowed me to take as many classes as I 
        wished in the statistics and machine learning departments (including <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701/">10-701</a>,  
        <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/syllabus_f13.pdf">36-705</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/">36-702</a>). Thanks to their support,
        I have developed the skills I needed to pursue the questions that fascinate me.</p>
        <p>Disciplinary labels don't help us do interesting work.</p> 

        <h3>3. "You don't sound Australian!"</h3>
        I spent seven years in the USA, and I pick up accents fast. I'm a bit of a verbal chameleon.
