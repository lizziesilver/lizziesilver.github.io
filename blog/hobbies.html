<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I enjoy singing in sightreading choirs. I used to sing with the Choir of Ormond College 
(now disbanded). I was in the choir for the 2005 tour, and when we recorded the CD 
'<a href="http://www.move.com.au/disc/laughing">Laughing</a>'. I also sang with the choir 
of Scots Church in Melbourne, although I have no religious affiliation. I enjoyed
the challenge of doing new music every week, and I appreciate Douglas Lawrence's relaxed
but hyperefficient conducting style.</p>

<p>Since moving to Pittsburgh I spent a year in the Bach Choir of Pittsburgh and a year in 
CMU's Repertory Chorus. They were fun experiences, but I am still looking for a Pittsburgh choir
that lets me do new music every week, and maintains an excellent musical standard, but 
doesn't spend too much time rehearsing. </p>
